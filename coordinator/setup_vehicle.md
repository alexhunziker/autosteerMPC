# Setup the test vehicle

Setting up the test vehicle is a bit tricky. The following proces has to be followed

1. Connect Raspberry Pi and Lidar with the power supply.
2. Connect the raspberry pi to the steering unit.
3. Immediatly after plug in the purple cable into the development boards positive lane (doesn't matter which one the two lanes are interwired)
4. Immediatly after press the button on the battery pack of the vehicle to start energy supply (this will stop the servo motors from acting out)
5. start the Script on the Raspberry pi
6. if the lidar does not start, push the button of the white power-bank
7. Flip the switch only once the script is running (the controller board overheats extremely quickly)
